Mining of Large Datasets


Data Analysis and Exploration: Algorithms and Applications

This course focused on algorithms for data analysis and exploration, emphasizing both practical and theoretical aspects of handling large volumes of data. Throughout the course, we became acquainted with highly efficient algorithms for data partitioning, ranking, association rules, recommendation systems, as well as algorithms for detecting communities and interesting events in social networks.

A significant component of the course involved working on a project, where we implemented selected algorithms mentioned above in a Hadoop clusterâ€”an exceptionally efficient system for processing large-scale data. Furthermore, we analyzed real-world data as part of our project work.

Key highlights of the course:

- Understanding and implementing efficient algorithms for data analysis and exploration
- Practical and theoretical aspects of handling large volumes of data
- Familiarity with data partitioning, ranking, association rules, recommendation systems, and community/event detection algorithms
- Hands-on experience with implementing algorithms in a Hadoop cluster
- Real-world data analysis and interpretation

By the end of the course, we had gained a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental algorithms used in data analysis and exploration. We had gained practical experience in implementing these algorithms within a Hadoop cluster and applied our skills to real-world data analysis scenarios.
